# Remove root directory wrapper scripts

This PR removes all wrapper scripts from the root directory and updates documentation references to use scripts from the scripts/ directory directly.

## Changes

1. Moved `quick-start.sh` to the scripts directory
2. Updated all documentation references to point to scripts in the scripts/ directory
3. Updated .devcontainer/devcontainer.json to only make scripts in scripts/ executable
4. Removed all shell scripts from the root directory

## Testing Done

- Verified all script paths in documentation
- Confirmed all scripts are now in the scripts/ directory
- Validated that tasks.json is still referring to the correct paths
